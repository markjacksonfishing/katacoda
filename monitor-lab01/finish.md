During this lab we have seen how Sysdig Monitor provides deep visibility into your containerized infrastructure and out of the box allows to:

- Explore the containerized infrastructure and a microservices application.
- Monitor a web services application using key metrics and monitoring approaches:
  - Golden signals and application metrics monitoring
  - USE resource and container limits monitoring
  - Kubernetes orchestration and kube-state-metrics monitoring
- Identify performance bottlenecks in the application, in this case a CPU bottleneck
- Confirm that scaling the application can handle the required load
