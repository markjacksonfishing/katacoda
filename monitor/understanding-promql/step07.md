## Review

<div class="lecture-text-container">
<p>We've now looked at all the various features of PromQL.</p>
<p>From selectors to choose the data you want to work with, functions to apply various logic and math, aggregators to analyse across labels and operators to join up time series.</p>
<p>Practical examples of PromQL were shown. Finally how to access PromQL via the HTTP APIs and recording rules were covered.</p>
