This course covers how to manually enable Pod Security Policies (PSPs from here on out) in your cluster. Although anyone willing to learn can take this course, we recommend some K8s previous experience and a base knowledge about PSPs. To cover this, we have prepared [two basic PSP scenarios](link to courses) you can take before taking this one. The goal of this course is to provide a deep dive on every step required to enable PSPs in your cluster, so you can understand what is happening under the hood.
