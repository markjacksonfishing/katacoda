This alternative explained which steps to take directly in a production cluster without running into problems. This is not the only alternative available to use kubernetes PSP features securely. 
If you have available two clusters (a test and a production environments) you can just run your application in the `test` cluster, where you don’t even have PSPs enabled. With Sysdig PSP Advisor, you don’t need PSPs enabled to simulate and generate your PSPs. You just need to simulate on `test` your new PSP and refine it until you are happy with the result. Once that you have created the best possible PSP on the `test` cluster, you can simply apply it into your production cluster - where you have PSP enabled - without any doubt that it will won’t break your application.
