Now that we have the perfect policy, we can replace the permissive PSP (test-psp) with the validated one (and optionally redeploy your app). Letâ€™s do it with:
```
Kubectl apply blabla
```{{execute}}

If we apply a policy with the same name as an existing one, this command will substitute it. Another important thing to be aware of is that Pod Security Policies are not namespace dependent, they are global resources.
