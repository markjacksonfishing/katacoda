In Sysdig Secure, navigate to Policies > PSP Advisor. 

Here we can see all the PSP simulations currently running in Sysdig Secure. You can also see general information about them, like the status, scope (we can choose against which namespace we want our policy to be simulated. By default, it will be tested against the whole cluster) and PSP file name.

If this is the first time you play with this, you won't have any. Now you'll be creating the first one. Select `New Simulation` on the top right corner.
