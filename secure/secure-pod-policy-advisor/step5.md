Let's look at these policies and rules a little closer by way of a real life example.

We would like to raise an event if a new directory is created on a container as this could be a sign of malicious activity, such as command injection.

The steps we'll go through are

 1. Create the rule in the Rules Library
 2. Add the new rule to a policy, and set the policy scope
 3. Test our new policy containing our rule
