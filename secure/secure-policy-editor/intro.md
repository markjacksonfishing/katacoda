A Sysdig Secure Runtime Policy is a combination of rules about activities an enterprise wants to detect in an environment, the actions that should be taken if the policy rule is breached, and, potentially, the notifications or other actions that should be invoked.

Policies are made up of one or more 'rules'. Tight Falco integration with policy rules allows you to define custom trigger conditions or append to an existing list.

A list of rules is provided out of the box, and these can be imported in for use in your policies. You can scope the security policy using container, cloud and Kubernetes metadata, and all can be classified using tags and labels.
