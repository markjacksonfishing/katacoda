You may wish to remove this test policy and policy rule you just created, so it has no affect on your system.

Because the rule is used within a policy, you have to delete the policy before you delete the policy rule used within it.

To delete the Policy, navigate to 'Policies > Runtime Policies', then search for and highlight the rule you added, 'Directory Created on container'.

Click on the three dots on the right and select 'Delete Policy'
