The Sysdig Rules Library provides a comprehensive runtime security library right out of the box consisting of container specific policies from Sysdig's threat research team, Falco open source community rules as well as international security benchmarks, for example CIS and MITRE ATT&CK.

Rules are categories by tags, so you can group them, for example, by functionality, security standard, or by target.  The two search boxes allow you to search for a particular rule by rule name or by tag. You can also see the origin of the rule and when it was last updated, which is useful for audit purposes.
