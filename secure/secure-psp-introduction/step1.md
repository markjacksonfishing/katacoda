What Are Admission Controllers?
-------------------------------

An Admission Controller is a plugin that intercepts requests to the Kubernetes API server after the request is authenticated and authorized but before implementation of the request.

There are a variety of admission controller in K8s ranging from those to deny `exec` be run on privileged containers to automatically attaching region or zone labels to PersistentVolumes.
