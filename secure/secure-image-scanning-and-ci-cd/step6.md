The pipelines will not work, unless you provide your DockerHub credentials and the image name that the pipeline will build and scan.

Let's begin with the credentials creation. Click on **Credentials** to create a new one.

Now, click on the **(global)** link to show all the credentials in the global scope (which should be empty).

You can create the credentials using the **Add Credentials** button.

Docker Credentials
------------------

In the `Kind` field select "Username with password", and insert credentials for [Docker Hub](http://hub.docker.com).
The key part here is that you _must_ write **"docker-repository-credentials"** in the **ID field**.
