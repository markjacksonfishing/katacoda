Click on the "Sysdig" tab and log in the Sysdig Secure web UI. You can click the ![pop-out](/sysdig-devel/courses/scvs/lab05/assets/00_pop_out.png) icon to open this in a new tab in your browser.

Alternatively you can point your browser at <https://secure.sysdig.com>.

Once logged into Sysdig Secure click on ‘Image Scanning' on the left menu.

If you then click 'Runtime', you’ll be taken to a view that shows the current security status of your environment.

You’ll see a a list of all unscanned images (the exact number of images may vary from the screenshot here).

You can also limit the scope of what is displayed in the same way you can in Sysdig Monitor by clicking on the drop down on the top left hand side which defaults to ‘Hosts & Containers’, or change the groupings with the dropdown.
