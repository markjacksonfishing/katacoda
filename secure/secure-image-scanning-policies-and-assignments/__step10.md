You can either wait for the alert to detect the new image and automatically scan it, or once the image appears in the Sysdig Secure UI, again click on it and choose ‘Scan Now’. It may take a minute or two for the image to appear. The UI will show both the updated image as well as the old image as it shows everything that has existed over the past hour. You should now see that the image no longer has high or critical vulnerabilities.
