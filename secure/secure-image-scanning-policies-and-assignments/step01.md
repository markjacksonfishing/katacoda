Click on the "Sysdig" tab and log in the Sysdig Secure web UI. You can click the ![pop-out](/sysdig-devel/courses/scvs/lab05/assets/00_pop_out.png) icon to open this in a new tab in your browser.

Alternatively you can point your browser at <https://secure.sysdig.com>.

If you're currently logged into Sysdig Monitor, then click spade icon in the upper left choose Sysdig Secure - use the same credentials you have been using for Sysdig Monitor so far (not any team scoped login you may have created in the last lab).

Once logged into Sysdig Secure click on ‘Image Scanning' on the left menu.

If you click on ‘Image Scanning’ then 'Runtime' on the left, you’ll be taken to a view that shows the current security posture of your environment.

You’ll see a a list of all unscanned images (the exact number of images may vary from the screenshot here).

You can also limit the scope of what is displayed in the same way you can in Sysdig Monitor by clicking on the drop down on the top left hand side which defaults to ‘Hosts & Containers’, or change the groupings with the dropdown.
