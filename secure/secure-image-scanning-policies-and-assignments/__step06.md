The default groupings of images might not be helpful, so create your own grouping to group against namespaces and deployments. From the ‘Runtime’ page of Image Scanning, click the dropdown on the top left and then click ‘Configure Groupings’.

From here, click on ‘Create New Grouping’

Create a grouping of your choice. Feel free to play around with different levels. Use the search feature by just typing ‘namespace’ or ‘cluster’ and then selecting the full annotation. Give the grouping your own name that makes sense when returning to it later. Below is an example.
