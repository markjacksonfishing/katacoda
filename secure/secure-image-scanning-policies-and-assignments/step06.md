<!-- Inline scanning https://github.com/sysdiglabs/secure-inline-scan -->

In the preceding example the scan was initiated from the Web UI - this could also have been initiated by tools like Jenkins as part of CI/CD pipeline. In  either case the image is pulled down from the associated repository to the Sysdig backed to be scanned.
