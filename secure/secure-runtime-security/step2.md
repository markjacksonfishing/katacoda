We will install the Sysdig Agent using Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes, which is already installed and initialized.

We can view the current status of our cluster using the command  
`kubectl get pod -n kube-system`

Once all the pods are running, we can deploy the Sysdig Agent in a few seconds, as it only takes a simple command:

`helm install --name sysdig --set sysdig.accessKey=YOUR_OWN_ACCESS_KEY,sysdig.settings.tags="cluster:training\,location:europe" stable/sysdig`

After copying the above command, you can paste it into the terminal using the right button of your mouse.  Remember you have to use **your own access key**.

This will result in a Sysdig Agent Pod being deployed to each node, and thus the ability to monitor any running containers.

You can see that the sysdig agent has been deployed:  
`helm list`

Creating the containers may take a little time.  Run the command below, which waits for all pods to be ready.  
`watch kubectl get pods`  
When the pods show status `Running`, hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd> and clear the screen.
